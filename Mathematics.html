            <h6>Thesis with which I obtained the undergraduate degree in mathematics</h6>
            <p>
                Associated with a directed graph <em>G</em> and a sequence that represents net flows at the vertices of <em>G</em> we can define a polytope whose points correspond to flows through the directed edges of <em>G</em>.
                The family of polytopes obtained in this way are called flow polytopes and are the subject of recent study. Stanley-Postnikov and Mezsáros-Morales-Striker proposed a procedure to construct different subdivisions of a flow polytope.
                For the net flow sequence (1,0,...,0), any such subdivision turns out to be a triangulation. We study the dual graphs of such triangulations for a particular family of graphs known as <em>Caracol graphs</em>,
                previously studied by Benedetti et al., and whose associated flow polytopes have normalized volumes given by the <em>Catalan numbers</em>.
                We show that the dual graph of one of the triangulations turns out to be 1-skeleton of the <em>simplicial Associahedron</em> and the other is a toggle graph that is obtained through inversion operations on the set of <em>Dyck paths</em>.

                <h4>A unifying framework for the ν-Tamari lattice and principal order ideals in Young's lattice</h4>
            </a>
            <h6>In collaboration with Matias von Bell, Rafael S. González D'León & Martha Yip</h6>
            <p>
                We present a unifying framework in which both the ν-Tamari lattice, introduced by Préville-Ratelle and Viennot,
                and principal order ideals in Young's lattice indexed by lattice paths ν, are realized as the dual graphs of two
                combinatorially striking triangulations of a family of flow polytopes which we call the ν-caracol flow polytopes.
                The first triangulation gives a new geometric realization of the ν-Tamari complex introduced by Ceballos, Padrol and Sarmiento.
                We use the second triangulation to show that the h∗-vector of the ν-caracol flow polytope is given by the ν-Narayana numbers,
                extending a result of Mészáros when ν is a staircase lattice path. Our work generalizes and unifies results on the dual structure of two subdivisions of a polytope studied by Pitman and Stanley.

                <h4>On Framed Triangulations of Flow Polytopes, the ν-Tamari Lattice and Young's Lattice</h4>
            </a>
            <h6>In collaboration with Matias von Bell, Rafael S. González D'León and Martha Yip</h6>
            <p>
                We study two combinatorially striking triangulations of a family of flow polytopes indexed by lattice paths ν which we call
                the ν-caracol flow polytopes. The first triangulation gives a geometric realization of the ν-Tamari complex introduced by Ceballos,
                Padrol and Sarmiento, whose dual graph is the Hasse diagram of the ν-Tamari lattice introduced by Préville-Ratelle and Viennot.
                The dual graph of the second triangulation is the Hasse diagram of the principal order ideal determined by ν in Young's lattice.
                We use the latter triangulation to show that the h*-vector of the ν-caracol flow polytope is given by the ν-Narayana numbers, extending the result of Mészáros when ν is a staircase lattice path.
